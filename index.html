      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than one percent of the U.S. population. When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation. However, with treatment, most symptoms of schizophrenia will greatly improve and the likelihood of a recurrence can be diminished.</p>

      <h3>Eduard Einstein</h3> 
      <p>The youngest child of Albert Einstein was studying medicine when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 20. He spent many years in and out of a psychiatric clinic in Zurich, Switzerland. By the time the famous physicist died in 1955, the younger Einstein hadn’t seen his father for more than 30 years. </p>

      <h3>Aaron Carter</h3>
      <p>The former teen pop star, rapper, and dancer says he’s dealing with several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia. This lifelong condition can affect you in profound ways. Some people have hallucinations or delusions, which is when you see, feel, or believe things that aren’t real. Others might speak in nonsense, or have trouble with their memory and reasoning. Carter says he’s on several medications to manage his symptoms.</p>

      <h3>John Nash Jr.</h3>
      <p>By age 30, he was known as one of the world’s most brilliant mathematicians. Then paranoia, delusions, and other symptoms of schizophrenia took hold. Nash’s descent into mental illness lasted for 20 years. But he slowly improved and returned to teach at Princeton University. In 1994, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Russell Crowe played Nash in the Oscar-winning movie A Beautiful Mind.</p>

      <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
      <p>Hallucinations, including hearing voices, are a common symptom of schizophrenia. Some scholars say van Gogh’s behaviors may have stemmed from that disorder. According to one account, van Gogh, during an argument with fellow painter Paul Gauguin, heard someone in his ear say, "Kill him." Instead, van Gogh took a knife and cut off part of his own ear. Some psychiatrists think he might have had depression or bipolar disorder instead.</p>

      <h1 class="h1-right">WHAT CAUSES SCHIZOPHRENIA</h1></header>
      <p class="padding">If you know someone with schizophrenia, you probably want to know why they have it. The truth is, doctors don’t know what causes this mental illness. Research shows it takes a combination of genetics and your environment to trigger the disease. Knowing what increases the chances can help you put together a better picture of your odds of getting schizophrenia.</p>
      <br>
      
      <h1 class="h1-right">Is Schizophrenia Genetic?</h1></header>
      <p class="padding">Think of your genes as a blueprint for your body. If there’s a change to these instructions, it can sometimes increase your odds for developing diseases like schizophrenia. Doctors don’t think there’s just one “schizophrenia gene.” Instead, they think it takes many genetic changes, or mutations, to raise your chances of having the mental illness.</p>
      <br>

      <h1 class="h1-right">What Are Your Chances of Getting Schizophrenia Genetically?</h1></header>
      <p class="padding">Your chances are highest -- 50% -- if you have an identical twin with the disorder. But some people with schizophrenia have no history of it in their family. Scientists think that in these cases, a gene may have changed and made the condition more likely.</p>
      <br>

      <h1 class="h1-right">Genetic Causes of Schizophrenia</h1></header>
      <p class="padding">Many genes play a role in your odds of getting schizophrenia. A change to any of them can do it. But usually, it’s several small changes that add up and lead to a higher risk. Doctors aren’t sure how genetic changes lead to schizophrenia. But they’ve found that people who have the disorder may be more likely to have problems in their genes that may interfere with brain development.</p>

      <header><h1>WHAT ARE THE 4 MAIN TYPES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA?</h1></header>
      <h3>Schizophrenia looks different from one person to the next. But there are four main categories into which patients fall:</h3>

      <h1>Paranoid schizophrenia</h1>
      <p>We define rows and columns on our grid with the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two lines on the grid.</p>
      <br>

      <h1>Catatonic schizophrenia</h1>
      <p>The person shuts down emotionally, mentally and physically. “People appear to be paralyzed. They have no facial expression and may stand still for long periods of time,” she says. There is no drive to eat, drink or urinate. When catatonia lasts for hours, it becomes a medical emergency.</p>
      <br>

      <h1>Undifferentiated schizophrenia</h1>
      <p>The person has various vague symptoms. “They may not talk or express themselves much. They can be confused and paranoid,” says Dr. Bowers. The person may not bother to change clothes or take a shower.</p>
      
      <h1>Schizoaffective disorder</h1>
      <p>The person has delusional thinking and other symptoms of schizophrenia. “But they also present with one or more symptoms of a mood disorder: depression, mania and/or hypomania,” says Dr. Bowers.</p>
      
      <h3>How do doctors diagnose the type of schizophrenia?</h3>
      <p>If the patient is admitted, the psychiatrist talks to them and evaluates their behavior, considers whether any symptoms were triggered by alcohol or drugs, reviews any records from prior admissions, and talks to the family.</p>
      



    
    <section class="main-section" id="symptoms">
      <header><h1>WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS</h1></header>
      <img class="img2" src="https://www.verywellmind.com/thmb/V8VpL7QdH_hu8fAgSMRLwISrrpc=/900x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/what-are-the-symptoms-of-schizophrenia-2953120-cba74c5e1dd942ecafde1824217603f9.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:</p>
      <h3>Delusions</h3>
      <p>
       These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.
      </p>
      <br>

       <h3>Hallucinations</h3>
      <p>
       These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
      </p>

       <h3>Disorganized thinking</h3>
      <p>
       Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br><br><br>
       <h3>Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior</h3>
      <p>
       This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.
      </p>
      <br>

       <h3>Negative symptoms</h3>
      <p>
       This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.

      <h3>WHAT ARE THE PHASES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA</h3>
      <h1>The phases of schizophrenia include:</h1>
   
      <h3>Prodromal</h3>
      <p>This early stage is often not recognized until after the illness has progressed.</p>
      <p>Symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> withdrawal from social life or family activities</li>
        <li> isolation</li>
        <li> increased anxiety</li>
        <li> difficulty concentrating or paying attention</li>
        <li> lack of motivation</li>
        <li> struggling to make decisions</li>
        <li> changes to normal routine</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Active</h3>
      <p>Also known as acute schizophrenia, this phase is the most visible. People will show the telltale symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, suspiciousness, and delusions.</p>
      <p>Symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hallucinations or seeing people or things no one else does</li>
        <li>paranoid delusions</li>
        <li>confused and disorganized thoughts</li>
        <li>disordered speech</li>
        <li>changes to motor behavior (such as useless or excessive movement)</li>
        <li>lack of eye contact</li>
        <li> flat affect</li>

      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3>Residual</h3>
      <p>Though not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5, this term may still be used to describe a time when individuals with schizophrenia have fewer obvious symptoms (the psychosis is muted). However some symptoms are still present.</p>
    <p>Symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> lack of emotion</li>
        <li> social withdrawal</li>
        <li> constant low energy levels</li>
        <li> eccentric behavior</li>
        <li> illogical thinking</li>
        <li> conceptual disorganization</li>
        <li> frank vocalizations</li>

      </ul>
